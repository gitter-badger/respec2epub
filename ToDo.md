# Functional todo-s

## Current code

* If the diff file is not reachable, it will be silently ignored. Ideally, the corresponding code should then be removed from the generated code! In general, if a reference cannot be reached, then the reference should probably be removed.

## Additional 

These are mainly for the service part:

* Web interface, with minimal API (should the non-respec reflected there? maybe through a different URI, i.e., entry point?)
* How to return, through HTTP, an ebook
