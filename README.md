ReSpec to EPUB
==============

Python script to assist in turning W3C Respec documents into EPUB. The script does **not** aim at being a generic HTML->EPUB solution, it is indeed tailored at W3C Respec documents. 

Note that the goal is:

- a command line tool to generate an EPUB 3 version of a spec, whether in respec or converted from respec
- a wrapper around the tool to provide a web service
- extension of respec to call out to that service, installed at a stable space (probably on labs.w3.org)

A [documentation in HTML](https://rawgit.com/iherman/respec2epub/master/Doc/build/html/index.html) is also available, giving more details.
