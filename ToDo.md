# Functional todo-s

## Current code


## Additional 

These are mainly for the service part:

* Web interface, with minimal API (should the non-respec reflected there? maybe through a different URI, i.e., entry point?)
* How to return, through HTTP, an ebook


# Quality todo-s

* Try to make it more functional, maybe (like editors should be returned from the function rather than added directly like now)
