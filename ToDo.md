# Functional todo-s

## Current code

* The dated URI should be extracted from the document, rather than from the URI
* Remove the usage of ASSETS for resources retrieved from the document; instead, mirror the structure
* (Maybe) change the term ASSETS to something else (W3C_ASSETS?)
* Add video media types to document.py

## Additional 

These are mainly for the service part:

* Web interface, with minimal API (should the non-respec reflected there? maybe through a different URI, i.e., entry point?)
* How to return, through HTTP, an ebook


# Quality todo-s

* Try to make it more functional, maybe (like editors should be returned from the function rather than added directly like now)
* The Session should not include references to zip and book creation
