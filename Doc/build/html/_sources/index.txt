   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Respec to EPUB's documentation!
==========================================

Python package to assist in turning W3C TR documents into EPUB3. The
package is **not** a generic HTML->EPUB3 solution, it is indeed tailored
at W3C TR documents. Furthermore, the current version relies on `ReSpec <http://www.w3.org/respec/>`__: files should either
be generated by ReSpec prior to using this script, or are ResPec "sources" that are are transformed into HTML
on the fly using a separate `Web Service set up (at W3C) <https://labs.w3.org/spec-generator/>`__ for that purpose.

The package can be used as a command line tool or can be the core of a separate Web Service
(it will be installed, eventually, on the `W3C Labs site <https://labs.w3.org/epub-generator/>`__. Finally, the plan is
to extend the save menu of Respec so that the service can be invoked from within respec when the user generates the final output (see the
`ReSpec <http://www.w3.org/respec/>`__ documentation for further details.


.. See the separate :doc:`manual pages <manual>` for the usage of the packages.

Dependencies
------------

The package relies on Python 2.7. It does not seem to run on Python 2.6 (there are some missing libraries, as well as missing features in existing libraries).

The script does not work (yet) with Python 3; the underlying libraries (e.g., HTML5Lib) seems to have issues with encoding, UTF-8, etc.

Apart from the standard Python libraries the package also depends on
`HTML5lib <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/html5lib>`__, an HTML5 parser library for
Python. The package has been tested with version 0.99999 of that library; earlier versions had Unicode
encoding issues, and should not be used.
