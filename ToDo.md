# Functional todo-s

## Current code

* If the diff file is not reachable, it will be silently ignored. Ideally, the corresponding code should then be removed from the generated code! In general, if a reference cannot be reached, then the reference should probably be removed.
* why don't I get proper exception report from the server when there is an exception? (It currently silently stops...)


# Quality todo-s

* Find out if it is possible to control the name of the return file when a service is run...
* Add an option for the unpublished respec document (hm. that may not work because there is no such thing as a short name for that one...)
